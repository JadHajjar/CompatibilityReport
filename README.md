# Compatibility Report version 0.7.6

Compatibility Report mod for [Cities: Skylines](https://steamcommunity.com/app/255710/workshop/). This reports compatibility issues and missing dependencies for your subscribed mods.

### Current status
This mod is available at the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633433869). This is a successor to the [Mod Compatibility Checker](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/AutoRepair) by aubergine.


### Implemented features
* Detection of subscribed and local mods.
* XML catalog with basic mod information and compatibility information.
* Review of subscribed mods with the catalog information.
* Text report, sorted by mod name. Split into multiple categories, based on issue severity.
* Automatic download of a new catalog. No need for a mod update for every new mod or compatibility change.
* Support for mod groups, to allow different editions (e.g. stable and test) of mods as mod requirement.
* Catalog Updater method (for mod maintainer only), based on web crawling the Steam Workshop and CSV import.
  * Automatically detects new mods and changes in mod information: name, required DLC/mods, source URL, ...
  * Easy catalog maintenance with simple CSV files for updated mod and compatibility information. This allows for catalog maintenance by multiple people in the future.
  * Automatic change notes and catalog versioning.
  * Gzipped catalog for lower bandwidth usage (partially implemented).
  * Manual upload of a new catalog, after a quality assurance check.

### Disclaimer
I'm not an experienced programmer. I knew programming fundamentals and taught myself C# with online tutorials, reading other peoples code, browsing Stack Overflow and lots of experimenting. My code is surely sloppy, inefficient and ignoring lots of conventions. I'm open to suggestions and constructive feedback in the [Discussions section](https://github.com/Finwickle/CompatibilityReport/discussions).
