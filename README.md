# Compatibility Report v2

Compatibility Report mod for [Cities: Skylines](https://steamcommunity.com/app/255710/workshop/). This reports compatibility issues and missing dependencies for your subscribed mods.

### Current status
This mod will be available soon on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2881031511). This is the official continuation of the Compatibility Report by Finwickle and [Mod Compatibility Checker](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/AutoRepair) by aubergine.


### Implemented features
* Detection of subscribed and local mods.
* Gzipped XML catalog with basic mod information and compatibility information. The Mods itself includes the most actual catalog. No need for side downloads and no issues with download limits or non accessible storage any more.
* Review of subscribed mods with the catalog information.
* HTML and/or text report, sorted by mod name. Split into multiple categories, based on issue severity.
* Mod options for easy access to reports, catalog download, feedback via report-form or on discord, links to recommended mods and also broken mods.
* Support for mod groups, to allow different editions (e.g. stable and test) of mods as mod requirement.
* Basic translation frame work (UI and catalog standard fields. Languages for notes will be integrated later)
* Catalog Updater method (for mod maintainers only), based on web crawling the Steam Workshop and CSV import.
  * Automatically detects new mods and changes in mod information: name, required DLC/mods, source URL, ...
  * Easy catalog maintenance with simple CSV files for updated mod and compatibility information. This allows for catalog maintenance by multiple people.
  * Automatic change notes and catalog versioning.
  * Dedicated UI for easier maintenance.
